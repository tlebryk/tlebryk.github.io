    <title>Theo in Hong Kong and Stuff - Articles</title>
    <description>A smorgasbord of psuedo-scientific observations about Hong Kong, clickbate headlines, and the thing the internet most needs: another food blog.</description>

        <title>Fermented Black Bean Pumpkin</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is probably my favorite recipe to make, in part because it was the first thing I learned from my original sifu. Also in part because this is the one recipe that, when I cook it for other people, they are actually like “oh this was not bad.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What People are Saying about the Protests Part I</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first part in an ongoing series of posts excerpting different perspectives I encounter on the protests in Hong Kong. This is in no way a representative sample of Hong Kong, nor should these people be thought to speak for everyone in their demographic. However, hopefully this gives some color, and alternative perspectives, to what the media is publishing about the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
