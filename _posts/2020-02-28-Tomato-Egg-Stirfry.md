There are tons of versions of this classic Hong Kong comfort food but every one I've found does this recipe the proper way. That is: scramble the eggs, remove, stir fry tomatoes, and then add eggs back in at the end.
No one (by that I mean sample size of four Hong Kongers I cook with) actually cares enough to go through the work of scrambling first then cleaning the pan.

This post gives you the "lazy" way of stir-frying the tomatoes, then cooking the eggs in the tomato juice. Honestly, I feel like very little is lost by not doing two separate processes. In fact, this way is harder to botch. If you do them separate, you have to time things right so as to not overcook and dry out the eggs. This one, you kinda just eye-ball until you no longer have raw eggs in your tomato juice. Lastly, the legit way comes out more like scrambled eggs with tomato juice on top. If you prefer runny eggs, this way comes out more like tomatoes with eggs floating around. Upon writing that, I realize that sounds pretty unappetizing, but you actually get the eggs mixed thoroughly with the juice, meaning every egg bite is sweet.


Ingredients
  * 5 eggs
  * 3 tomatoes
  * ~ 2 tablespoons Sugar
  * ~1 tablespoon of Salt
  * Optional add ins: scallions, ketchup, Pepper/chili flakes

Serves: however many people can eat 5 eggs and three tomotoes….so like 4 normal people for breakfast?

Instructions
  1. Whip the eggs like scrambled eggs To be fluffier, add water to the mix.
  2. Cut tomatoes into thin wedges (~1/8s).
		a. The goal is to perserve as much juice as you can. One trick is to make the initial cut on a divet to bleed less. Subsequent cuts can be made in a bowl if you're mad skilled and not liable to cut yourself. If you're a clutz like me, just try and cut with the round side facing down and flat side upwards. Immediately throw pieces into a bowl to catch as much of the juice as you can.
  3.  Heat oil In pan and add any optional fragrants such as scallions.
  4. Stir fry the tomatoes in a wok until you have a layer of juice on the wok and the tomatoes are no longer stiff.
  5. Once enough liquid has accumulated, add the whisked eggs. Because there is no butter/little oil, you will need to scrape the eggs off the bottom of the wok occasionally.
  6. Once there appears to be no more runny eggs, add sugar, chili flakes and ketchup to taste and stir.
  7. Garnish with additional scallions if you want.


More notes:
- What I love most about this recipe is that it is super easy to make it to your tastes. You can easily taste the tomato juice throughout and alter to make it spicy, sweet, or salty. A two to one sugar to salt ratio seems good to me but I know I generally run sweet over salty.
- Same with mouthfeel: you can make mushier tomatoes, big tomatoes, etc. based on how you cut it.
- Other cultures have their own version of this dish. If your mouth isn't feeling particularly Asian, spices such as Thyme, Dill, or latin-y hot sauce go well with eggs and tomatoes.
- Basically throw anything on this and it'll probably be fine. i.e. you can stirfry garlic, ginger, chili peppers, or scallions before or garnish at the end.
- Generally 1-2 more eggs than you any amount of tomatoes you choose is a good rule of thumb, as long as your tomatoes aren't enormous.
