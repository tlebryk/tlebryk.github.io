I was recently notified by one of this blogs many readers (honestly if you're reading this, 1/4 chance I'm talking about you) that I probably am not eating enough protein and what not so these next couple recipes I'll try and incorporate some more protein. Today's recipe uses imitation chicken to try and fill that void.

After the black bean Kabocha, this is my second go to recipe. I can't find any version of this on the internet, so it's possible this is material exclusive to tlebryk.github.io.

For a bit of kick at the end, I use Chiu Chow sauce, but Gochuchang can complement the rice cakes to go full on Korean.
