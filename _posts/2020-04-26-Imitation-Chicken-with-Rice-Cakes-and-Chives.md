After [the black bean kabocha]({{ site.baseurl }}fermented-black-bean-pumpkin), this is my second go-to recipe.

This is a mostly straight forward stir-fry except the order of adding ingredients is important. You want to add the rice cakes right at the time the cabbage is releasing enough water to steam the rice cakes. The chives and cabbage are basically indestructible, but the chicken, wood ear, and rice cakes can burn if the heat is too high and there isn't any liquid on the bottom of the pan. Adding a bit of cooking alcohol around step 11 and keeping the heat from being too high towards the end can help.

You can go pretty light on the sauce add-ins as the marinade and natural flavors make this tasty without a ton of salt or sugar. For a bit of kick at the end, I use Chiu Chow sauce, but Gochujang can complement the rice cakes to go full on Korean.

Ingredients
  * Food
    * 1 package of [imitation chicken](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vegetarian-chicken.jpg) (the tubeish looking kind)
    * 30-40 [Rice Cakes](assets/images/rice-cakes.JPG)
    *  20 dried [wood ear mushrooms](https://www.etsy.com/listing/270434212/dried-mushroom-jews-ear-wood-ear-jelly?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_e-home_and_living-food_and_drink-herbs_and_spices_and_seasonings-other&utm_custom1=f0dacfb8-fada-43c3-b7b9-baac636073e6&utm_content=go_1844702805_72389388409_346398291049_pla-306107311609_c__270434212&utm_custom2=1844702805&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0IW3nfGG6QIVD47ICh3tiwe4EAkYBiABEgK_EvD_BwE), soaked
    *  10 leaves Napa cabbage
    *  1 bundle of Chinese chives (the ones with the flowers)
    *
  * Marinade
    * soy sauce
    * Shaoxing wine
    * sugar
    * sesame oil
    * white pepper
    * corn starch  
  * Stir-fry add-ins
    * 3 cloves garlic, minced
    * Cooking oil
    * Shaoxing wine
    * Soy sauce
    * Vegetarian oyster sauce
    * Chiu Chow chili oil (潮州辣椒油)


Instructions
  1. Wash, then soak the wood ear mushrooms for 20 minutes +. Drain the water and remove for any hard residue.
  2. Slice the imitation chicken into thin disks
  3. Marinate by adding soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar, sesame oil, white pepper, and corn starch (in that order) to a Ziploc bag. Mix well with the imitation chicken and let sit for 20-30 minutes.
  4. After removing the base and flower tips of the chives, cut them into 1-2 inch pieces
  5. Cut the cabbage into 1-2 cm thick strips. You can just stack the leaves and do them all at once. Make the strips along the stem thinner and the leaves thicker.
  6. Heat the minced garlic on the pan with cooking oil
  7. Add the Chives
  8. Once the chives have wilted some, bunch the garlic and chives to one side of the wok.
  9. Add the imitation chicken. They should have direct contact with the wok/oil. Don't stir.  
  10. Flip the disks after 1-2 minutes or there is some browning on the side in contact with the wok.
  11. Add the wood ear mushrooms and stir fry for 30 seconds
  12. Add a bit of soy sauce
  13. Add the Napa cabbage on top and cover the wok
  14. Once the cabbage wilts a bit, add the rice cakes on top. Make sure they are as separate as possible, or else they will stick together once softened.
  15. Cover and lower the heat to let the steam cook the cakes for 5 minutes (or until rice cakes visibly soft)
  16. Mix all the ingredients and turn up the heat to dry off any excess water.
  17. Once reasonably dry, add soy sauce, vegetarian oyster sauce, and .5 tablespoon of chili oil. Mix and serve hot.
